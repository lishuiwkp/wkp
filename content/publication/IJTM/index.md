abstract: Building and improving the national green technology transfer system is significant for maintaining regional sustainable development. Based on the interprovincial green patent transfer data from 2006 to 2020, this paper constructs China’s regional green technology transfer networks (CGTTNs) and studies the evolution of structural properties and the mechanisms of endogenous evolution. Results from social network analysis (SNA) and temporal exponential random graph model (TERGM) show the following. Firstly, the relationships within China’s regional green technology transfers are becoming increasingly close, and the green technology transfer system has improved consistently over time. The reciprocity effect among provinces still needs to be improved, i.e., the ability and efficiency of CGTTN organizations to use and integrate supplementary resources still need to be improved. Secondly, CGTTNs experience structural dependence effects, and the Matthew effect and the connectivity effect among regions are obvious. Nonetheless, the transitivity effect among regions needs to be improved, i.e., the technology flow of CGTTNs has hierarchical characteristics, but has not yet formed network clustering. Thirdly, CGTTNs have intertemporal dependence effects, and path dependence and path creation coexist. This finding is helpful in understanding the formation mechanism of CGTTNs, and this in turn helps to provide knowledge to accelerate the diffusion of regional green technology innovation.
